            <p>The purpose of this individual project was to make an efficient process for DevMountain to create and deliver surveys, and manage survey results. This project utilized the full MEAN stack. Previously, surveys were done via Google Docs. The survey system I designed is a template-based survey administration system <span class="boldText">that has been implemented by DevMountain</span>. An administration main menu has selections for creating / modifying templates, sending surveys and viewing results. Students see links to requested surveys when they log in. They click on the link, take the survey, then return back to the previous screen. Mongo DB collections include templates, surveys, users, results, and topics. There were 29 server endpoints.

            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a system to allow students to blog and communicate their feelings to other students. A difference from a typical blog is that students choose an emotion level from 1 through 10, with 10 being highest, and their emotion is tracked along with what they were working on at the time. This project utilized the full MEAN stack. I worked with a group of 2 other student developers. My responsibility was primarily back end and filtering logic. I handled passport local auth and DevMountain auth. I also wrote query logic for quick filters and advanced search. Code is being acquired by DevMountain.

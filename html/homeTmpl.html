            <h4>DevMountain Survey Enhancement</h4>
            <p>This purpose of this project was to make an efficient process for DevMountain to create, deliver, and manage survey results, using the MEAN stack. Currently, surveys are done via Google Docs. Students are messaged when surveys are available, with the message including a link to the survey. Many students ignore the messages and don't take the surveys. Creating and modifying surveys take too much of the teacher's time. Results are available in Excel for each individual survey.</p>
            <p>The survey system I designed is a template-based survey administration system that could be integrated into the DevMountain website. An administration main menu has selections for creating / modifying templates, sending surveys and viewing results. Templates are the building blocks of surveys. You can build a new template from scratch, or modify an existing one. Templates can use variables, which are enclosed with double $$'s: e.g. $$var_name$$. This allows the adminstrator to set variables when sending surveys, avoiding having to create a large number of templates.</p>
            <p>The select template drop down box integrates Materialize CSS framework and Angular, using ng-options to display a variable number of template options. Each question in the template is a directive that is ng-repeated for the array of questions. There are 3 question types: numeric, boolean, or text. Numeric are assumed to be a range, with options for low value and high value. Questions can be removed by clicking the X to the right of the question, or added by clicking the Add New Question button at the bottom. If you try to save an existing template without changing the name, a Modal pops up, asking if you are sure you want to overwrite the existing template. A successful save takes you back to the Admin Main Menu, with a toast.</p>

        <p>Doug Alderman 2.0 graduated from <a href="https://devmounta.in/web-immersive" target="_blank">DevMountain</a> web programmer immersive bootcamp program in March 2016. He acquired full stack developer skills focusing on the Javascript-based <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN</a> stack (Mongo Database, Express Server, Angular Front End, and Node environment). Doug is eager to work again as a programmer, using the latest technologies.</p>
        <p>Doug Alderman 1.0 was an experienced developer working with IBM 4690 point-of-sale (POS) registers from 1991 through 2004. This system used a proprietary IBM operating system (4690) that was engineered specifically for the needs of retail POS. He worked for companies such as American Stores / Albertsons, Thrify Drug Stores, and Linens 'N Things. He coded the terminal sales application in a language called CBASIC (more BASIC than C). He also coded controller application and Verifone Everest pinpad code in the standard C language. Doug participated in the full development cycle, and led projects for POS software releases. Doug was promoted to a senior system analyst position at Albertsons. </p>
        <p>Between 1.0 and 2.0, Doug semi-retired and applied his skills to creative pursuits such as writing. He also recently worked almost 2 years in a call center doing IT technical suport.</p>

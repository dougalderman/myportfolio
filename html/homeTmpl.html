        <p>Doug Alderman 2.0 graduated from <a href="https://devmounta.in/web-immersive" target="_blank">DevMountain</a> web programmer immersive bootcamp program in March 2016. He acquired full stack developer skills focusing on the <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN</a> stack. Doug is eager to work again as a programmer, using the latest technologies.</p>
        <p>Doug Alderman 1.0 was an experienced developer working with IBM 4690 point-of-sale (POS) registers from 1991 through 2004. This system used a proprietary IBM operating system (4690) that was engineered specifically for the needs of retail POS. He worked for companies such as American Stores / Albertsons, Thrify Drug Stores, and Linens 'N Things. He coded the terminal sales application in a language called CBASIC (more BASIC than C). He also coded controller application and Verifone Everest pinpad code in the standard C language. Doug participated in the full development cycle, and led projects for POS software releases. Doug was promoted to a senior system analyst position at Albertsons. </p>
        <p>Between 1.0 and 2.0, Doug semi-retired and applied his skills to creative pursuits such as writing.</p>

            <p>This purpose of this project was to make an efficient process for DevMountain to create and deliver surveys, and manage survey results. This project utilized the full MEAN stack. Currently, surveys are done via Google Docs. Students are messaged when surveys are available, with the message including a link to the survey. Many students ignore the messages and don't take the surveys. Creating and modifying surveys take too much of the teacher's time. Results are available in Excel for each individual survey.</p>
            <p>The survey system I designed is a template-based survey administration system that could be integrated into the DevMountain website. An administration main menu has selections for creating / modifying templates, sending surveys and viewing results. Students see links to requested surveys when they log in. They click on the link, take the survey, then return back to the previous screen. Mongo DB collections include templates, surveys, users, results, and topics.

            <p>This app is a online quiz with the option of using a picture as part of the question, or pictures as answer options. It allows for multiple choice, short answer, and true-false types questions. There are 3 text-only questions types, 3 picture question type, and one picture answer multiple choice, for a total of 7 question types.</p> 
            <p>The app uses .json configuration files for all quiz information. The app uses only front-end Javascript frameworks Angular 1.x and Angular UI Router. Click <a href="http://dougalderman.github.io/angular-pictureQuiz/#/" target="_blank">here</a> for a demo.</p>

        <p>Doug Alderman 2.0 graduated from <a href="https://devmounta.in/web-immersive" target="_blank">DevMountain</a> web programmer immersive bootcamp program in March 2016. He acquired full stack developer skills focusing on the Javascript-based <a href="http://mean.io/#!/" target="_blank">MEAN</a> stack (Mongo Database, Express Server, Angular Front End, and Node environment). Doug is eager to work again as a programmer, using the latest technologies.</p>
        <p>Doug Alderman 1.0 was an experienced developer working with IBM 4690 point-of-sale (POS) registers from 1991 through 2004. This system used a proprietary IBM operating system (4690) that was engineered specifically for the needs of retail POS. He worked for companies such as American Stores / Albertsons, Thrify Drug Stores, and Linens 'N Things. He coded the terminal sales application in a language called CBASIC (more BASIC than C). He also coded controller application and Verifone Everest pinpad code in the standard C language. Doug participated in the full development cycle, and led projects for POS software releases. Doug was promoted to a senior system analyst position at Albertsons. </p>
        <p>Between 1.0 and 2.0, Doug semi-retired and applied his skills to creative pursuits such as writing. He also recently worked almost 2 years in a call center doing IT technical suport.</p>
